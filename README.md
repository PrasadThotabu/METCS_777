Task 1: Top-10 Active Taxis (5 points)
Many different taxis have had multiple drivers. Write and execute a Spark Python program that computes
the top ten taxis that have had the largest number of drivers. Your output should be a set of (medallion,
number of drivers) pairs

Task 2 - Top-10 Best Drivers (15 Points)
We would like to figure out who the top 10 best drivers are in terms of their average earned money per
minute spent carrying a customer. The total amount field is the total money earned on a trip. In the end, we
are interested in computing a set of (driver, money per minute) pairs.
